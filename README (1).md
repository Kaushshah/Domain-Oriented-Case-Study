Problem Statement Summary:

Company Overview: Schuster is a multinational retail company specializing in sports goods and accessories. They conduct significant business with multiple vendors, with whom they have credit arrangements. However, some vendors tend to make late payments, leading to financial impact and non-value-added activities for Schuster's employees who must chase payments.

Goals:

Understand customersâ€™ payment behavior and predict the likelihood of late payments against open invoices.
Segment customers based on their past payment patterns.
Build a classification model to predict whether a payment will be delayed at the invoice level.
Identify important predictors of late payments and draw business insights from the developed model.
Data Preparation:

Utilize received payment data, including invoice details and payment dates.
Filter out observations where the invoice value is less than 0.
Derive the target variable indicating whether payment was made on time or late.
Derive features such as payment term in days and customer-level attributes through segmentation.
Model Building & Evaluation:

Identify important predictor attributes for late payments.
Build and evaluate multiple classification models to predict delayed payments.
Apply the final model on open invoice data to suggest real-time application for future data.
Aggregate model outputs at the customer level for actionable insights.
Expected Results:

Conduct exploratory data analysis to extract useful insights.
Segregate customers into different groups based on payment patterns.
Build a classification model for predicting delayed payments.
Apply the model on open invoice data and identify customers requiring precautionary measures.
